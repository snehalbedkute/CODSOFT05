##  Task Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

---

##  Aim

To detect fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression, focusing on handling class imbalance and evaluating model performance on real-world transaction data.

---

##  Dataset

- **Name:** `creditcard.csv`
- **Description:** Contains anonymized credit card transactions with features like transaction amount, time, and a binary label (`Class`) indicating fraud (1) or not (0).

---

##  Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn.model_selection`
- `sklearn.preprocessing`
- `sklearn.linear_model` 
- `sklearn.metrics` 
- `imblearn.over_sampling`

---

##  Task Summary

- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand the class distribution.
- Identified and addressed class imbalance using oversampling techniques.
- Preprocessed the data with scaling using `StandardScaler`.
- Built a **Logistic Regression** model to classify transactions.
- Evaluated the model using a classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

##  Conclusion

This task demonstrates how logistic regression can be used effectively for binary classification problems like fraud detection. Special focus was given to class imbalance, a common challenge in fraud detection, and the use of oversampling significantly improved the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions.
